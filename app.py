        This student-focused allowance tracker is designed to be:

        - **Simple**: One clean dashboard with clear numbers.
        - **Supportive**: No guilt, no judgment, just information.
        - **Persistent**: Your data lives in a local JSON file,
          so it survives browser refreshes and app restarts.

        ### How it works

        - Log your **income** and **expenses** on the Dashboard.
        - Adjust your **monthly allowance** as your situation changes.
        - Use **Insights** to understand your average daily spending,
          safe daily limit, and category patterns.
        - Experiment with **CSV Analysis** using past exports from any tool.
        - Revisit **Previous Months Data** to see gentle summaries over time.

        The goal is to keep you within a **comfortable, safe spending range**
        while reducing surprise and stress around money.
